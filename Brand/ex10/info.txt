ex10
- ex10.cpp
- makefile
boost needs to be installed on local server and path needs to be modified in makefile

to compile call: make
-> g++ -I /usr/local/boost_dir ex10.cpp -o ex10 -std=c++11 -fopenmp

Output of edges of steinerTree is not submitted since program crashes on big graphs beacuase of output

Program is called
./ex10 'path_to_gph_file' 'no_threads' 'n_source_nodes'

-> example:
./ex10 ./exampleGraphs/big8.gph 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
calls ex10 on big8.gph with 4 threads and searches on initial source nodes 1,2,3,...,14,15

# Exercise 10: Parallel Steiner Tree Heuristic

Extend exercise 9 such that it can be run in parallel (shared memory, e.g. OpenMP for C/C++).
Furthermore, extend your program such that it tries each of the ***first n (user defined parameter) terminals*** as starting points for the Steiner tree heuristic and keeps the best result.
Your program should be executable as follows:

*prog file.gph n_start_points*

It should provide the following output

*TLEN:	xxxx*

*TREE:	(from,to)	(from,to)	...*

*TIME:	cputimeall	in	seconds	and	fractions,	like	1.637*

*WALL:	wall-clocktime without	reading	and	printing	and	checking*



***Please note that this is the last exercise of the lecture and that it will play a major role in the final grading***
